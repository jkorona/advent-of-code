# Advent Of Code 2021

My attempt to complete tasks from https://adventofcode.com/2021

## How to run

1. Set correct version of Node.JS. I'm using version `16.1.0` and that's goto engine. You can use `nvm`.

2. In order to run the test for solutions from particular days use following command
```
> npm run start <DAY>
```
for example
```
> npm run 5
```
